#### RNDM
I'm a hoarder when it comes to saving bookmarks, but I often don't revisit any of them. This extension aims to solve that problem by opening a random bookmark you have saved everytime you visit chrome's new tabs page.

###### Features to add:
1. Options page allows user to specify which folder to open rndm bookmarks from.
2. ability to mark bookmark as read.
